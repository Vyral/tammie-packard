Today I’m joined by Karen Johnson of Waterstone Mortgage to answer a few quick questions about an important part of the home buying process: getting pre-approved for a mortgage loan.&nbsp;

**First, why is it important to get pre-approved?**

According to Karen, getting pre-approved instead of just pre-qualified means all of your documentation will be reviewed and you’ll get an accurate estimate of your capability to obtain a mortgage loan. Your lender will check your income documents and asset documents to make sure you can from point A to point B (the closing) without any issues.

**When people provide their documentation for the loan, do they ever say one thing while their documentation says something else?**

Yes—Karen can gain verbal information from a buyer, but once she reviews the documentation, she might find out from a pay stub or an employment verification that the actual income she can utilize for the repayment ability of a mortgage loan is different. This may improve their scenario or reduce the income she can use.&nbsp;

**What happens when a buyer goes shopping for a home without a pre-approval in our competitive seller’s market?**

In this case, the buyer might get very excited about making an offer on a home only to discover that they don’t even qualify to buy it. When this happens, everyone involved in the situation is impacted, including the listing agent.&nbsp;
