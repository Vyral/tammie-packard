Today we’re going to be going over a few important questions that every house hunter should be asking:

**1\. "How is the neighborhood or area?** We get a lot of questions about how close homes are to I-75, major airports, and traffic.&nbsp;

**2\. What amenities are included in 55+ communities?** Many people want to be in these communities because they are maintenance-free and host awesome daily and weekly social activities in the community. You barely have to walk out your front door to have a good time in some places, but it’s definitely something that you’ll want to know about.

**3\. What fees will you have when buying a home?** Potential expenses could include your HOA fees, CDD fee, and flood insurance. CDDs come with a majority of neighborhoods and can increase your taxes. As for flood insurance, you definitely want to determine whether you’re in a flood zone or not. You might have a monthly maintenance fee if you are living in one of the maintenance-free communities.
